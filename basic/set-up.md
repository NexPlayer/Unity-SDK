The NexPlayer package is composed of 3 different packages:  

- **NexPlayer SDK**, which is mandatory to import in order to use NexPlayer.  
- **NexPlayer Full Feat Sample**, which contains a full-featured sample containing all the possibilities of the NexPlayer SDK.  
- **NexPlayer Simple Sample**, which contains sample scripts that show how to implement basic functionality of the NexPlayer SDK.

The NexPlayer package supports Unity versions 2019 and upwards.

## Updating the SDK

### Updating the package from SDK version 2.1.4 or higher

To update the current Unity Package, select **NexPlayer** in the top toolbar and navigate to **Import Tool â†’ Update Package**. A contextual window will appear to help you select the new Unity package to import.  
The tool does not remove any custom files allocated in the *NexPlayer* and *WebGLTemplates* folders.
